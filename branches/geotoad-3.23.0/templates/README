Warning:
Not all templates are equally well-maintained.
Some of them may never have been used more than twice.

While gpsbabel tries to conform to every format it knows about,
its author Robert Lipe appreciates hints and corrections
(see the gpsbabel-code mailinglist) as much as we do for the
non-gpsbabel stuff.
