.TH "GEOTOAD" "1" "30 Nov 2014" "steve8x8@googlemail.com" "Geocaching Query Tool"

.SH "NAME"
geotoad \- geocaching query tool

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
.B geotoad
 will invoke text user interface (TUI)
.PP
.B geotoad \fI[options]\fR \fB[--]\fR \fI<search>\fR
 (command-line version)

.SH "NOTE"
If GeoToad was not installed from a (distribution-specific) package
(like .rpm for RedHat, OpenSuse, CentOS and derivatives; .deb for Debian
and Ubuntu, etc.), it may be necessary to invoke GeoToad with the
.B .rb
suffix, as in \fBgeotoad.rb\fR, \fB./geotoad.rb\fR, \fBruby geotoad.rb\fR
or even \fBruby1.9.3 geotoad.rb\fR
(if the \fBruby\fR in your PATH is not the one you want to use).

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
GeoToad is software to help speed up the boring part of geocaching:
choosing the cache(s) to target, and collecting the available data.
.PP
GeoToad lets you perform queries against the Geocaching website,
and export the matching geocaches to numerous devices and over 20 file formats.
.PP
If run without any parameters,
.B geotoad
will launch the interactive mode ("text user interface", "TUI").
It can also be used in command-line mode for specific queries.

.SH "DISCLAIMER"
GeoToad uses the public web pages created by GroundSpeak, to gather information
about geocaches. It does not use the official API. Therefore, GeoToad's way
of accessing information can be interpreted as "spidering" which is forbidden
by GS's Terms of Use.
Strictly speaking, using GeoToad may harm your GeoCaching account and possibly more!

The authors have taken a few measures to reduce the impact of the website access,
including a progressive slowdown for bigger queries, but there is no safe limit.

The software is provided as-is, also in source form, for educational purposes.
By using it to gather actual geocache descriptions and related information,
you accept all liability for possible damages.

.SH "OPTION SYNTAX"
Where \fBmultiple entries\fR are possible (e.g. for cache sizes, owners, etc.,
marked by \fB(MULTI)\fR below),
they can be delimited by a pipe symbol (\fB|\fR) or a colon (\fB:\fR),
or you can define your own delimiter(s).
Make sure the pipe symbols are properly escaped from the command shell!
.PP
\fB"No-argument"\fR options, with the exception of \fB--verbose\fR which
implements a counter, are \fB"toggles"\fR, i.e. they can be switched
on by the first usage on the command line, switched off by the second, etc.
.PP
\fB(USERFILE)\fR - if the user name is followed by an "equal" sign and a filename
(as in \fIusername\fR\fB=\fR\fIfilename\fR),
instead of querying the server the first column of the file is interpreted as
GCxxxxx cache IDs.
\fBWarning:\fR Since colons are used as default \fB(MULTI)\fR delimiters,
if you want to use a file from another (Windows) drive, or with a filename
containing a colon for another reason, you will have to define your own
delimiter (set) - see the \fB-m\fR option for that.

.SH "OPTIONS"
Option keywords are case-sensitive, and may be separated from values by whitespace
or an equal sign \fB=\fR.
Options can be unambiguously abbreviated, for example, \fB--password\fR may be written
as \fB--pas\fR (but not \fB--p\fR).
.PP
\fB-h\fR|\fB--help\fR
    get a short command-line option summary
.PP
\fB-v\fR|\fB--verbose\fR|\fB--debug\fR
    enable debugging output - very helpful in case of malfunctions.
    Multiple (currently up to 3) \fB-v\fR options raise the debug level, resulting in copious output.
.PP
.B User credentials:
.PP
\fB-u\fR|\fB--user\fR|\fB--username\fR \fIusername\fR
    geocaching.com username (required)
.PP
\fB-p\fR|\fB--password\fR \fIpassword\fR
    geocaching.com password (required)
.PP
\fB-P\fR|\fB--proxy\fR \fIproxy\fR
    HTTP proxy server, http://username@password@host:port/
.PP
.B Query type:
.PP
\fB-q\fR|\fB--queryType\fR \fItype\fR
    query type (default: \fBlocation\fR), choose from
      \fB[location|coord|user|owner|country|state|keyword|wid|guid]\fR

  Use \fBcoord\fR if you already have coordinates.
  Coordinates may be given in the usual (Google Maps) representations:
    dd.ddddd
    dd mm.mmm
    dd mm ss[.sss]
  - possibly containing a degree symbol and a sign prefix.
Both latitude and longitude must use the same representation.
  \fBlocation\fR will use the Google Maps API to translate into coordinates.
  \fBcountry\fR and \fBstate\fR queries require a \fInumerical id\fR which the TUI may tell you.
.PP
.B Output control:
.PP
\fB-o\fR|\fB--output\fR \fIfilename\fR
    (first) output file name (default: created from query argument(s) and options)
    In case of multiple output formats, subsequent file names are derived from this one.
.PP
\fB-x\fR|\fB--format\fR \fIformat\fR  \fB(MULTI)\fR
    output format type(s) (default: gpx)
    See the \fBOUTPUT FORMATS\fR section below for the list of supported formats.
.PP
\fB-w\fR|\fB--waypointLength\fR \fIlength\fR
    set EasyName waypoint id length. (default: 0=use WID)
    \fINote\fR: negative values are no longer allowed.
.PP
\fB-l\fR|\fB--logCount\fR \fIcount\fR
    limit number of log entries (default: 10)
    Currently, there is a maximum of 10 imposed by GC's interface.
.PP
.B Limit queries:
.PP
\fB-y\fR|\fB--distanceMax\fR|\fB--radius\fR \fI0.01-500[km]\fR
    distance maximum in miles or km (default: 10mi)
    Applies to \fBlocation\fR and \fBcoord\fR queries only.
.PP
\fB-L\fR|\fB--limitSearchPages\fR \fIcount\fR
    limit number of search pages (default: 0=unlimited)
.PP
\fB-Y\fR|\fB--noCacheDescriptions\fR
    do not fetch nor parse cache descriptions, search only
    This will reduce the amount of server requests, but provides no means
to determine (and use for filtering) cache coordinates, hints, attributes, or descriptions.
.PP
\fB-Z\fR|\fB--preserveCache\fR|\fB--keepOld\fR
    do not overwrite existing cache description files in file cache
.PP
.B Filtering options:
.PP
\fB-c\fR|\fB--cacheType\fR|\fB--type\fR \fItype\fR  \fB(MULTI)\fR
    set cache type(s), select from
      \fB[traditional|multicache|virtual|letterbox|\fR
      \fB event+|event|cito|megaevent|gigaevent|\fR
      \fB lost+found|lfceleb|block|\fR
      \fB unknown+|unknown|gshq|ape|\fR
      \fB webcam|earthcache|exhibit|wherigo]\fR
    If \fBonly one type\fR is selected, search will be sped up considerably
by reducing the number of queries sent to the server.
    By suffixing one or more cacheType(s) with a minus sign (dash) "-",
you may invert the filter,
i.e. \fBunknown-\fR will return only non-mystery caches.
    Inverse filters are applied before, and therefore supersede, forward filters!
(This means, \fBtype:type-\fR will exclude \fBtype\fR.)
    \fBevent\fR and \fBunknown\fR do not include "special" types.
To search for "all event" (including cito, mega, and giga, and some 
rare other events) or "all unknown" (including Groundspeak HQ) types,
use
\fBevent+\fR, or \fBunknown+\fR respectively,
\fBas the only cache type\fR (otherwise,
filtering won't work - you've been warned).
    Warning: Inverted filtering for these types does \fBnot\fR work!
    Also, these types may not be supported by the TUI.

Cache descriptions will never be removed!
.PP
\fB-m\fR|\fB--delimiter\fR \fIdelimiter(s)\fR
    delimiter(s) to be used for \fB(MULTI)\fR input, default "|:"
    The TUI uses "|".
You may try "^" to avoid delimiters that have to be "escaped" ("quoted").
.PP

    retrieve "my logs" page containing links to all (cache) logs, and store in cache
.PP
\fB-X\fR|\fB--disableEarlyFilter\fR
    emergency switch to disable early (cache-list based) filtering by difficulty/terrain/size
    This may be required should the representation of those values change again,
after 2010 and 2012.
Normally you don't want to use this!
.PP
\fB-U\fR|\fB--unbufferedOutput\fR
    switch output to unbuffered (useful for wrappers)
.PP
\fB-V\fR|\fB--version\fR
    show version information only (can be combined with \fB-C\fR)

.SH "SEARCH ARGUMENT"
\fIsearch\fR can be of the \fB(MULTI)\fR type.
This, for example, allows you to combine multiple circular search spots
into a single search - the query results will be merged.
(Be warned that some output fields, like distances and directions, may become ambiguous!)

.SH "SPECIAL CASES"
If your \fIsearch\fR item(s)
(according to the \fBqueryType\fR)
start with a dash (minus sign),
it has to be "hidden" from the option parser.
This, in Unix tradition, is done by inserting a "double dash" \fB--\fR
between the last option and the search argument(s).

Characters like \fB!\fR and \fB|\fR may have to be "escaped" from the shell,
usually by enclosing them, or the whole string, in quotes.

If \fBuser\fR or \fBowner\fR names contain special (non-ASCII) characters,
and you are using Windows, you may not be able to login or run a "user" query.
In those cases, you'll have to pre-encode those characters.

.B http://www.utf8-chartable.de/unicode-utf8-table.pl?number=1024
will help you to look up the proper UTF-8 codes.
Prefix each two-digit hex value with a percent sign, for example
.B (capital_letter_O_with_diaeresis)lscheich
will become
.B %c3%96lscheich
(The TUI may show strange characters, don't worry about them.)

If you're planning to use colons (e.g. for \fB(USERFILE)\fR) on the command line,
you may have a look at the \fB-m\fR option which allows you to redefine the
delimiter set.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
.B GEO_DIR
    If set, GeoToad will put its cache in this directory. If not the cache is
placed in ~/.geotoad/ . Note that it is not secure to set GEO_DIR to point
to a world-writable directory such as /tmp.
.PP
.B LANG
    To properly handle special characters (which are not in the ASCII character
set, such as umlauts, etc.) we recommend to set
.B LANG
to
.B en_US.UTF-8
or similar. The syntax depends on the shell you're using:
	.B setenv LANG en_US.UTF-8
for C-shell derivatives (csh, tcsh)
	.B LANG=en_US.UTF-8; export LANG
for Bourne and Korn shell (sh, ksh)
	.B export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
for Bourne Again shell and derivatives (bash, dash)

.SH "OUTPUT FORMATS"

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
\fINote:\fR Some of these examples may still no longer work as shown. Please help to fix this; see Issue 284 on GoogleCode.
.PP
.B  geotoad
  invokes the text user interface
.PP
.B  geotoad -u user -p password 27513
  Why do we need a username and password? In October of 2004, Geocaching.com
began to require a login in order to see the coordinates of a geocache.
Please note: Put quotes around your username if it has any spaces in it.
  You've just made a file named gt_27513.gpx containing all the geocaches
nearby the zipcode 27513 (Cary, NC - with a maximum distance of 10 miles)
suitable to be read by almost every GPSr device.
.PP
Here are some more complex examples that you can work with:
.PP
.B  geotoad -u user -p password -y 5 -q coord "N56 44.392, E015 52.780"
  searches for caches within 5 miles of the above coordinates
.PP
.B  geotoad -u user -p password 27513:27502:33434
  performs a multiple search, and combines the results into a single output.
  You can combine searches with a delimiter (default is "|", or ":" - except TUI).
  This works for all types, though it's most often used with coordinate searches.
.PP
.B  geotoad -u user -p password -x text -o nc.txt -n -q state 34
  Outputs a text file with all of the caches in US state North Carolina that are
virgins (have never been found).
  Please note that for state and country queries, the numerical id has to be used.
You may use the TUI to search for the country or state number.
  Warning: Querying a whole state can be dangerous and may harm your account!
For example, NC has (as of Oct 2013) more than 24k active caches.
  You may want to limit the number of search pages parsed (e.g. using \fB-L 10\fR),
as country and state searches return caches in reverse chronological order
(newest ones first).
.PP
.B  geotoad -u user -p password -x html -o palestine.html -q country 276
  Get a HTML representation of all caches in Palestine. (Oct 2013: 7, one of them unfound)
.PP
.B  geotoad -u ... -p ... -t 2.5 -E "helixblue:Sallad" -x gpx -o charlotte.gpx 28272
  Get caches in the 10-mile zone of zipcode 28272, with a terrain score of 2.5 or higher, 
which users helixblue and Sallad have not visited.
  Outputs a GPX format file, which is usable by most GPSr's and other devices.
.PP
.B  geotoad -u ... -p ... -t 2.5 -E anyname=/path/to/file -x gpx -o charlotte.gpx 28272
  As before, but read a list of GCxxxx cache IDs from a file instead of querying the server
for found caches.
.PP
.B  geotoad -u ... -p ... -b -K 'stream|creek|lake|river|ocean' -x html -o watery.html -q state 15
  Gets every cache in Indiana state with trackables that matches those water keywords,
and makes a pretty HTML file out of it.
.PP
.B  geotoad -u ... -p ... -x gpx -o mylocal.gpx -z -y 1.75 -T 4 -q coord "N 51 23.456 E 012 34.567"
  Create a GPX file with all caches around the given location,
max. 1.75 miles away, terrain rating below or equal 4, including disabled ones.
.PP
.B  geotoad -u ... -p ... -m '^+|' -o output.gpx -x "gpx+list|html" -y 2km -q coord "52.25,6.075^53.1,-7.2"
  Perform a search around two travel stops with a 2 kilometre radius, 
create three files output.gpx, output.lst, output.html combining the results.
  (Note the usage of the \fB-m\fR option to modify the set of delimiters.
As the \fB|\fR character has a special meaning, it must be "quoted".)
.PP
.B  geotoad -u ... -p ... -c multicache -a 6 -A 57 -o family.gpx -x gpx:list -y 25km -q coord "52.25,6.075"
  Prepare for a Sunday afternoon walk, and find all multi-caches around
which pretend to be "Kid friendly" (attribute 6) and shorter than 10km (attribute 57).
.PP
.B  geotoad ... (as above) --minLat 52.10 --maxLat 52.40 -q coord "52.25,6.075"
  This will further reduce the number of caches, by dropping all outside a "latitude zone".
  You may also define Eastern and Western limits, e.g. \fB--minLon 6.00 --maxLon 6.20\fR.
  Note that this is a \fBfilter\fR applied after querying the server.
.PP
.B  geotoad -u ... -p ... -z -q owner -- -aBcDe-
  Find all caches created by one owner, even the disabled or archived ones.
  Note that here the argument (owner name) has to be separated by \fB--\fR from the rest of the command line.
