Introduction

GeoToad 3.17.11 and later versions will use a dictionary to avoid unneccessary lookups of WID->GUID mappings.

If GeoToad doesn't find a file mapping.yaml it will create and fill it. You may take some of this burden off GeoToad (and the servers).

Here's how to initially create one before running GeoToad for the first time.
As always, instructions have been tested under Debian Linux, and should be easily adapted to MacOSX.
_Windows users: How did you solve this task? Please give feedback, I'll add your recipe(s)._

----------
Background
----------

Starting with the 20130821.1 HotFix, GS no longer provides GUIDs (their internal "database index") as part of the search results.
A temporary workaround consisted of looking up each and every cache_details page, effectively replacing all searches with "wid" ones.
This - together with some other incompatibilities - multiplied the number of server accesses by a factor of 2-10!

But the information is almost there: in the file cache, cdpf files have the guid in their names and the wid in the HTML text.

It's just a matter of extracting, and arranging this information suitable for GeoToad.

For easy lookup, the "dictionary" was implemented as a YAML file mapping.yaml representing a hash.
The file structure of such a file is simple: it consists of an initial line "---", followed by "wid: guid" lines.
This makes adding entries to the dictionary as simple as appending single lines to a text file.

The scripts
-----------

#!/bin/bash

[ -z "$GEO_DIR" ] && \
GEO_DIR=~/.geotoad

cd $GEO_DIR
(
# first line (YAML header)
echo '---'
# find individual files
find ./cache/ -name 'cdpf.aspx_guid_*' \
| while read file
do
    # extract guid from file name
    guid=`echo $file | sed 's~^.*guid_\([0-9a-f-]*\).*~\1~'`
    # extract wid from file contents
    wid=`cat $file | grep pageTitle | head -n1 | sed 's~^.*(\(GC[0-9A-Z]*\)).*~\1~'`
    # write hash entry
    echo $wid: $guid
done
) \
| sort | uniq \
> mapping.yaml

As always, you're supposed to understand what the script is doing, and take proper precautions (as backing up an existing mapping.yaml)!

If you don't like the order of entries (which usually would be random), you may sort the file, e.g. using:

#!/bin/bash

# sort mapping.yaml
input=mapping.yaml
output=mapping.yaml.new

(
echo ---
for pattern in \
    GC. \
    GC.. \
    GC... \
    GC.... \
    GC..... \

do
    grep "^$pattern:" $input | sort | uniq
done
) > $output
mv $input $input.SAVE.`date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S`
mv $output $input

This would even allow you to _merge_ multiple mapping files, by just concating, then sorting them - duplicates will be removed automatically.
(By the way, duplicate mappings in a hash wouldn't do any harm.)

You may check your mapping.yaml file within irb:

require 'yaml'
dict = YAML::load(File.open('mapping.yaml'))
puts dict.length

The resulting number of entries should be the number of lines in mapping.yaml minus one.
