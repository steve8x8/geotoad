Some hints for reporting bugs.




(The stable release of) GeoToad is supposed to work.
If it doesn't, there's a variety of possible reasons.
Please check the list below:

------------------------------------------------------------
Are you using the [CurrentDevelVersion development version]?
------------------------------------------------------------

 - If so, please do NOT submit an issue report.
 - Contact Steve8x8 at his GoogleMail account instead.
 - (See below for details which may help to isolate and reproduce the issue.)

---------------------------------------------------------
Have you upgraded to the [CurrentVersion latest release]?
---------------------------------------------------------

 - Check the [CurrentVersion] wiki page.
 - It may take a few days for it to notice, but GeoToad should tell you about available updates.
 - Note that "cross-grading" from development to stable versions cannot be done automatically!

-------------------------------------
There is nothing available for my OS.
-------------------------------------

 - We're very unhappy with it, but MacOSX (dmg) packages couldn't be built for quite a long time.
 - Work on stabilizing the build environment is still ongoing.
 - As a workaround, you may pick up the .tar.gz file - a working ruby installation is still necessary.
 - There are no plans to support individual OSes in terms of packaging. The tarball should cover most cases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I've got the latest version. It used to work, but now it's dead, Jim.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are more or less frequent [GCmaintenances updates to the web site] it queries (which may cause certain patterns not to match any longer), and there are real bugs.

To make it work for you again, we therefore need some input to be able to identify the problem.

 - Always try to reproduce the problem, and allow us to reproduce it as well - the TUI writes out a _sample command line_ that will be helpful.
 - Are you using a Ruby environment we haven't tested GeoToad against? 1.8.7, or 1.9.1/2 should be safe.
 - Toggle _verbose output_ on (using "v" in the TUI, or "-v"/"--verbose" from the command line), and write the (copious!) output to a file.
 - The last few lines might already give you an idea what could have happened.
 - Check for the last occurrence of "wid = " in the debugging output. A few lines before, there should be a line "cachefile: ...".
 - Rename that file in your cache. Do _not remove_ it, we might need it later.
 - Rename the debug output file too, and run again.
 - If the problem persists, we need the command line and the last output lines, starting with the "cachefile:" line, including the error thrown by Ruby.
 - Make sure you remove your credentials (password, perhaps username) and cookies from the command line and debug output.
 - If you are using _non-standard settings_ with gc.com's web pages (language, measurement units) that may also be important.
 - If the problem cannot be reproduced, the culprit seems to be the old cache file. Can you compare the two versions?

Before reporting an issue, please check with the [https://code.google.com/p/geotoad/source/list SVN browser] 
whether there might be a patch addressing your problem. 
Show-stopper fixes usually are committed directly to the trunk; 
development work takes also place in branches. 
Whether a commit went to trunk or branch can be seen by selecting it. 
You are welcome to review the changes, and leave your comments and suggestions
