How do you enable friendly waypoint id names?
---------------------------------------------
These synthesized names are a feature named EasyName. 
Set your maximum EasyName length (--waypointLength or -l, 
for Garmin we recommend 16), and they will be enabled.

Geocaching Swiss Army Knife complains about the GPX format. How do I make them compatible?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't use EasyName waypoints.


-------------------------------------------
What software can you use the GPX files in?
-------------------------------------------
Here are a few software products I have found that make use of GPX 
files. If you have any to add, please e-mail thomas%stromberg.org

--------------------------------
Why is there no GUI for GeoToad?
--------------------------------
Because we haven't gotten to it yet. There have been some
failed projects by 3rd party users to produce one, and we are
looking for developers to give us this capability in a future version.


----------------------------------
What are the "Fun Factor" ratings?
----------------------------------
Fun Factor is a 'synthesized' rating that is generated by 
parsing the geocache comments with a spam filtering engine that
has been taught what an exciting geocache is or a dull geocache.

If you would like to tune or calibrate this rating system, take 
a look at the files in tools/ to add new caches to your preference
database (data/). No documentation is available for these tools
at this time.

Fun factors may be replaced by favorite counts in the future.


------------------------------------------------
geotoad.exe gets relative paths wrong in Windows
------------------------------------------------
GeoToad for Windows in the past was packaged by rubyscript2exe,
which seems to forget the current working directory. Because of this,
if you are using a relative path, it will default to the directory
that GeoToad is installed to, rather than the working directory it
was launched from.

Since rubyscript2exe has been abandoned by its author, and doesn't
work any longer with recent Ruby versions, we had to change the packaging
to Ocra (a Ruby gem).
With the new packaging, unfortunately, we see GeoToad crash if it isn't run 
in the installation directory.
This crash is related to funfactors
which will disappear in the near future, to be replaced by favorite counts.
As a workaround, we suggest to make sure GeoToad is run from its own directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------
I cannot login with a name containing an umlaut ("ÜbercacherXY")
----------------------------------------------------------------
You're probably using Windows. 
(For unixoid systems, check your _locale_ setting $LANG for UTF-8.)

It seems to be impossible to use UTF-8 in a Windows cmd.exe environment;
there is a "Unicode" codepage (65001) which apparently uses UTF-16
(encoding each character into two bytes) which isn't suited for our purposes.

To enter non-ASCII characters within user/owner names,
you will have to look them up in 
[http://www.utf8-chartable.de/unicode-utf8-table.pl?number=1024 this table] 
(you may have to scroll further) and prefix each two-digit hex number from 
the third column with a percent sign, as in %c3%9cbercacherXY. 
_(If you use the search page to list caches found by "ÜbercacherXY", geocaching.com will use the same encoding.)_

To enter a percent sign in the name, please use %25.

Don't be worried if you see strange characters in the TUI.


--------------------------------------
What about country and state searches?
--------------------------------------
Some previous versions of GeoToad already allowed country/state searches.
The code now has been rewritten to some extent, to handle the ambiguity of
names, and is in advanced testing state.

There's no reasonable way to clarify ambiguities when you're running the
command line version, and therefore, instead of giving a _name_ it is now
required to submit a unique country (or state) _ID_ (a numerical value).

Since there are more than 250 countries and about 400 states in
the list, and the lists are constantly changed by Groundspeak,
GeoToad's TUI helps you find out about the ID you are looking for:

 - Enter the Text User Interface (by running GeoToad without any parameters)
 - Select the search type ("country" or "state", from the list)
 - If in "country" mode, enter a name pattern for "country":
   - For "Sweden", "swe" will do; for the United States, "state" will give you a selection between "Vatican City State" (213) and "United States" (2).
   - Use the numeric ID for your "-q country ID" command-line query.
 - Note that "country" queries will fail if geocaching.com has "split" the country into states (regions, provinces, etc.) - proceed to "state" query in that case!
 - If in "state" mode, you will have to prefix the state pattern with a country pattern and a slash:
   - "swe/sterb" will return ID 374 for Sweden/Västerbotten; "ger/bra" will, through a country selection from Niger--Nigeria--Algeria--Germany (Germany, of course), lead to to Brandenburg (138).
   - To select from a full list of states (regions, etc.) of a given country, you may use a pattern like "France/.*".
   - Note that the patterns are "regex" style.
   - Use the numeric ID in your "-q state ID" query.

Country and state lists are kept in your file cache for about 2 months.
